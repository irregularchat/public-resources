- [ ] Protect Against Cyber Threats
Cyber threats can affect you, your family, and the mission!

1. Secure your device
    - [x] Turn off all wireless services not currently used. (WiFi, BT, GPS, NFC) 
        - Airplane Mode is not enough
    - [x] Delete saved Wi-Fi networks and disable auto-connect. Your device can broadcast where you have previously connected.
    - [x] Delete unused apps and disable unused app permissions
    - [x] Other good WiFi practices
        - Disable SSID broadcast. Use a generic name (i.e. “FBI Surveillance Van”) 
        - Use WPA3 and limit device connections
        - Enable MAC randomization
        - Only manually connect to WiFi, not automatic
    - [x] Update all your devices to the latest OS version and security patches
    - [x] Use a strong PIN to unlock your device, avoid fingerprint & face unlock
    - [x] Use encryption for your device storage/hard drives (Bitlocker, Veracrypt)
    - [x] Use secure deletion tools such as BleachBit
    - [x] Use protected browsing: Firefox, Brave, NoScript, Privacy Badger
    - [x] Use burner phones and numbers where possible

2. Secure your connection
    - [x] Use travel routers and hotspots instead of free WiFi
    - [x] Use encrypted messaging and calling apps: Signal (recommended), Element
        - Unsecure apps include: WhatsApp, Direct Message (DMs), Texting (SMS)
    - [x] Use a secure, paid VPN, eg. NordVPN, Mullvad, Proton VPN
        - Free VPNs collect data to be sold. Check VPNs often for security changes.
    - [x] Use a secure DNS. Search for “DNS over HTTPS”
        - Example: Quad9, https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query, 9.9.9.9 

3. Secure your online presence
    - [x] Enable End To End Encryption (E2EE) where possible (iCloud, etc.) 
    - [x] Use burner accounts for public interactions (shopping, etc.)
    - [x] Use Strong Passwords and Password Managers, eg. Yubico, Beem, Authy
    - [x] Reset / Disable AdTech on personal devices often, make it a daily habit
    - [x] Enable MFA using a mobile app or a physical device such as YubiKey
    - [x] Use privacy settings, do not post anything for the bad guys to see
