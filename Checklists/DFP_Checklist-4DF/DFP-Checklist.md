# Digital Force Protection Checklist
**NOTE:** _This checklist is intended for broad audiences not focused on any specific areas or requriments. The checklist is designed to include only actions which can be done with minimal googling and not to be all-inclusive._ 

## DOs

- [ ] Use complex passwords:
      - All account passwords should be password manager generated 22+ character passwords with UPPER, lower, numbers, and symbols too. 
- [ ] Opt-out of all “personalized” ads:
      - Disable “Advertising ID” on all devices.
- [ ] Turn off WIFI, GPS, and Bluetooth when not directly in use.
- [ ] Always use Multi-Factor Authentication:
      - Typically found under “privacy and security” account settings.
      - SMS is the least secure method.
- [ ] Google yourself and your family:
      - Request images or data to be taken down as needed. [[Templates/DMCA Takedown Notice]]
      - Update account privacy settings as needed.

## Don'ts

- [ ] Don’t reuse ANY passwords:
      - Breached passwords are sold and provided for free on the Dark Web. Even if you keep your password safe, companies can get hacked.
- [ ] Don’t write down passwords openly:
      - Use your password manager, which is end-to-end encrypted to store passwords, pins, and combinations.
      - Use auto-disappearing encrypted chat at a minimum to share combinations or pins.
- [ ] Don’t set privacy to “All,” “Public,” or “Everyone”:
      - Think of the Strava case study. Restrict posts and profiles to “only with friends” or “only with myself.”
- [ ] Don’t use SMS:
      - Use Signal or Element Messenger
      - Set your chats to auto-disappear by default.
